Redshift is a clustered warehouse and each cluster can house multiple databases. As expected, each database contains multiple objects like tables, views, stored procedures, etc.

Nodes and Slices
A node is a compute unit with dedicated CPUs, memory and disk. Redshift has two types of nodes: Leader and Compute. The Leader node manages data distribution and query execution across Compute nodes. Data is stored on Compute nodes only.
Slice is logical partition for disk storage. Each node has multiple slices which allow parallel access and processing across slices on each node
The number of slices per node depends on the node instance types. Redshift currently offers 3 families of instances: Dense Compute(dc2), Dense Storage (ds2) , and Managed Storage(ra3). The slices can range from 2 per node to 16 per node depending on the instance family and instance type; see this for details. The objective of this concept is to distribute the workload of queries evenly across all nodes to leverage the parallel compute and increase efficiency.


**********
- Number of files to be created when writing to S3 
- Avoid creating too many small files;
- If loading to Redshift, Number of files created should be equal to the number of slices in the cluster
